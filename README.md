This is a repo to work with and create a truely random smart contract lottery in a python environment:

1. Users can enter the lottery with ETH based on a USD fee.
2. an Admin will choose when the lottery is over.
3. the lottery will select a random winner.

How do we want to test this?
1. `mainnnet-fork`
2. `development`
3. `testnet`
